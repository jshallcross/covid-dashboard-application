# Positive-Covid-Dashboard
A dashboard geared towards showing positive progress in the fight against covid-19. Users can view updated provincial vacination data and view regional specific data by using the dropdown menu. 

This is my week 7/8 group project from the University of Toronto School of Continued Studies Coding Boot Camp. Our group decied to focus on the positive news surrounding Covid-19. At the time of development vaccinations in Canada had just begun. My role in the group was to work with the Covid-19 API, fetch the desired data and display it on out website. The Covid-19 API had some decent documentation but was difficult at times to use. The Google Maps API we used aloowed us a limited amount of requests and since deployment all alloted requests have been made so the map no longer centers with dropdown menu Health Region selection. We received a mark of 92%.
